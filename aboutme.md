I am a PostDoc at the *University of Salzburg*. 
My main interest is the connection of machine learning with topological/homological data analysis. 
In particluar, my focus is on the symbiotic combination of deep learning and persistent homology. 
Beneath my research, I regularly serve as a reviewer for machine learning conferences, e.g., ICML, NeurIPS.
